# videoAudioSorter

Original by Big Wade on YouTube:

[Steamed Hams but every single frame is sorted quietest to loudest (Seizure Warning)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79SaA8GkWZ8)

I did not create this, but I needed this in a repo for my own use.

## Description

This is a Python script that takes a video file and sorts every frame by the audio level. The result is a video where the frames are sorted from quietest to loudest.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python main.py
```
